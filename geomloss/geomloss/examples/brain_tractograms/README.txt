Scaling up to brain tractograms -- with Pierre Roussillon
-------------------------------------------------------------

Use unbalanced, regularized Optimal Transport to process
white matter fiber tracks.
The scripts presented below should allow you to reproduce
the experiments of the `Miccai 2019 <https://www.miccai2019.org/>`_ paper
**Fast and scalable Optimal Transport for brain tractograms**
by Jean Feydy\*, Pierre Roussillon\*, Alain Trouv√© and Pietro Gori.

N.B.: I'm currently very busy writing my PhD thesis, with a deadline
for the end of September. Both Pierre and myself
will clean up these scripts and document them fully for
the Miccai conference, which starts on the 13th of October.
